Unity source files for MegaChug, our submission for the GamesJobsLive Game Parade Summer 2021 game jam. 

You can find all the code, art and audio assets used in the jam here, as well as anything to get the project running in Unity. All assets were created by the team within a week, with polishing and bugfixing occuring over a few days after the first week of the jam. 

The game can be played online or downloaded for windows at: https://shanegames.itch.io/megachug
